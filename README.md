PHOTOIS
============

Photo location recommendation application using GPS information

***

## Project Introduction
 General users can receive recommend photo spots and compositions by immediately reflecting weather, time, and location information. We make it easy for user to take pretty pictures in places they visit for the first time, even in bad weather. It allows photographers to naturally build their portfolios by sharing information with each other.
